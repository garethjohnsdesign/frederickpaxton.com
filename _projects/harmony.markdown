The series is a view into the everyday life of Russian youth through the paradigms and preconceptions of sport. Social and gender roles of young males and females are explored through two most prominent sports in Russia - ice hockey and rhythmic gymnastics

The story is set in my home-town of Chelyabinsk- a distant place for me now, sprawling from the edges of mineral rich Ural Mountains.

As a system sport embodies in itself ideas and traits of its society. And its ethics is transferred in non-sport reality and behavior. For young boys and girls, it becomes a way, an attempt to step outside of the boundaries. From an early age they are taught to understand the prestige and the promise of an opportunity the training can bring, they are taught to follow the roles assigned to them by the society
Both of these sports are a subject of a fierce national pride-young boys and girls promote the prestige of the country, with all the pressure and responsibility that comes with it.
Both hockey and gymnastic with its nationalistic pride, beauty and painful reality is set against one of the most polluted and industrially brutal places in Russia, that to me still holds a powerful beauty. The long lost dreams of soviet scale, the gaudy colors of leotards, bad injuries left unnoticed, bright make up on the girls who are too young for it- all this holds deep memories for me and a heartbreaking humanity.

As it is usually seen by the spectator, rhythmic gymnastics is a harmonious blend of art and dance. The sport highly emphasizes femininity in girls, which is also inherent in Russian culture itself. The girl is being taught to sculpt her body, perfect her moves, be graceful in every moment, which can only be achieved with endless tedious repetition. From a very early age she becomes aware of her body and the hypnotizing effect it can have on the viewer.
Hockey on the other hand emphasizes the qualities, which are usually assigned to men-strength, power, competitiveness and no right to show oneâ€™s weakness.

The sport, for boys, also becomes a big social ladder, since the best hockey players in the country are being praised as heroes of our time. The players try to fulfill their roles as demi-gods to their fans, family and futures. While the young girls try on different roles and masks, prescribed for them by the society they live in.                                                          	
With limited resources and options Chelyabinsk can offer, the sport becomes a way of social mobility for the young girls and boys. The inherent beauty, fascination and pain that belongs to both sports becomes a necessity for the survival in this brutal place, as it was once for me.
                                                                                                                                         
The series is focused around the edges of sport- it is not the competition itself, but what happens prior to it, is what interests me the most. In this age of vulnerability, mostly during the training sessions the biggest, but harsh lessons of life are learned, through the coaches and families, pushing for perceived ideal- be it social success or simply an slender athletic body.

While they fiercely striving for perceived ideal be it athletic body, perfect life, social success or the only career opportunity, the promise of this ideal might never come true.
