“Europe's Edges; Ice Core Sampling” focuses on a much maligned angle of political theory, that of tracing and understanding the separations and effects of these perennial divisions. These lines, sometimes brought into being through little more than a pencil stroke, have a huge impact on the lives of people living their lives in these peripheries. Just as an ice core reveals a specific segment of local history, the work affords the viewer an insight into geographical and economic significance of specific points of intersection and the connections between them.
