The work was shot on location in Pyongyang, North Korea at the 2013 Arirang Mass Games and in Shigatse, Tibet, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
The use of the technique of a zoomed perspective and slow motion allows the viewer a portal into reality. The ambition of this mass spectacle is to show everybody working perfectly as a collective whole, but at a cropped distance you see each person as an individual, even when acting together in perfect harmony their own unique characteristics and personalities are revealed, leading me to the statement the ambition of conformity never breaks individuality.
