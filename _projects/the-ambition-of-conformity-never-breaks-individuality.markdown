The work was shot on location in Pyongyang, North Korea at the 2013 Arirang Mass Games and in Shigatse, Tibet, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China. 

A zoomed perspective and slow motion are employed to allow the viewer a portal into reality otherwise unseen. The games, an annual mass spectacle, are designed to showcase a populace working perfectly together as a collective whole. But a cropped distance reveals the unique characteristics and personalities of each individual participant, even when acting together in perfect harmony. The ambition of conformity, then, never truly breaks individuality.
