The work was shot on location in Pyongyang, North Korea at the 2013 Arirang Mass Games and in Shigatse, Tibet, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. 

A zoomed perspective and slow motion are employed to allow the viewer a portal into reality otherwise unseen. The games, an annual mass spectacle, are designed to showcase a populace working perfectly together as a collective whole. But a cropped distance reveals the unique characteristics and personalities of each individual participant, even when acting together in perfect harmony. The ambition of conformity, then, never truly breaks individuality.
