Every boundary contains an implied cultural value system. This project examines a number of global intersections that may at first appear as simple geographical connectors but hold far greater geopolitical significance and in turn social or political weight. In many cases they represent social ideals or act as signifiers for repressive states. In the simplest form, however, they are structures that either connect or disconnect depending on the validity of the participantâ€™s status and access to them.
