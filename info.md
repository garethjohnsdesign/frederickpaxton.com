Frederick Paxton is an Emmy-nominated filmmaker and photographer currently based in London. After graduating with honours from New York’s School of Visual Arts, he quickly established himself and captured a broad body of work. 

Whether in conflict zones like Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and the Central African Republic or North Korea, Russia and Europe’s periphery, there is a consistent arc of Paxton’s work: capturing the intersections and boundaries that help reveal so much about humanity.
