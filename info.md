Frederick Paxton is an Emmy-notimated filmmaker and photographer currently based in London.

Paxton is a London-native who graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York after studying both film and fine art.

Quickly establishing himself, he has captured a broad scope of work. From Iraq and Syria and the Ukraine to the Central African Republic, Somalia, Afghanistan, and beyond, there is a consistent arc of Paxtonâ€™s work: capturing the edges of humanity as seen in areas of difficulty and sharing them, thereby revealing humanity in a deeper and more meaningful way.
