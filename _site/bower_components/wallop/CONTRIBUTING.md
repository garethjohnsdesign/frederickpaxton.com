# Contributing to wallop
wallop is supposed to provide developers the basics and allow them to extend it via the API and Custom Events.
This is the reason why wallop has no Keyboard or Gestures bindings. I would like to keep it this way. 🙏

Bug fixes are more than welcome!
For any new feature please [submit an issue](https://github.com/peduarte/wallop/issues) first before send any pull request.

Thank you & happy contributing! 👊

## Tests
Please make sure all commits pass the tests `npm run test`.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```
Then open this up **http://localhost:9966/__zuul**

## Build
The build task `npm run build` runs the tests and does the minification.
