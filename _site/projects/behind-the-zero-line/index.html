    <p>In March 2015 Filmmaker Frederick Paxton obtained unique access to Zaitseva, Ukraine - a small, divided village trapped in the grey zone between the separatist (DNR) and Government front lines of Eastern Ukraine. This small village - already very poor and struggling at the best of times -  to Frederick seemed to represent a microcosm of the problems facing the country as a whole.</p>

<p>After two years of fighting, and thousands of civilian and military casualties, there is still no political will to bring a meaningful end to the conflict in the East. And with an official ceasefire in place much of the world has lost interest in Ukraine. But life – and war – goes on.</p>

<p>This slow-burn war documentary shows the traumatic, repetitive, and physically gruelling reality of daily life for the residents and soldiers trapped “behind the zero line”.  It aims to show the viewer a different idea of the conflict, not lead by statistics and numbers, but the human and social impact of the physical, mental and social divide caused by war.</p>

<p>The photographs that accompany the film explore the lives of the residents and soldiers forced into the conflict. From Rostik, a very young child whose nightmares are full of death, to commander Strelker, separated from his family and living in makeshift dugouts fighting to hold the the frontline.</p>

<p>We meet Babushka Ludmila, a brilliant woman and former meteorological engineer, who survived the German invasion during the Second World War, but is left cowering in her basement during nightly artillery bombardment.</p>

<p>As the narrative unravels, we see deterioration and destruction - both mentally and physically - of the families, citizens and soldiers wrapped up in this situation, and the deep frustration at the pointless conflict dividing and ripping apart both the country and people’s lives. Although against this stark backdrop, there are moments of hope - and the beauty of human nature attempts to push through the overwhelming bleakness facing this community.</p>
